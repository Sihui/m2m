### Convert Medium Posts To Markdown

> A good craftsperson prizes good tools — Anonymous

M2M is a nice [utility that converts Medium posts to
Markdown](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/convert-medium-posts-to-m/aelnflnmpbjgipamcogpdoppjbebnjea)
to help with my writing workflow. I write my essays using Medium, which is a
kickass writing tool, but publish them first on [my
blog](http://rangablog.curdrice.com), and afterwards publish the same article on
Medium.

It’s an extension for Google Chrome and Chromium. Click to [install from from
Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/convert-medium-posts-to-m/aelnflnmpbjgipamcogpdoppjbebnjea).

You should see an “M” icon in your toolbar after you install. Simply click on
the “M” icon when you’re on any Medium article (*also works in the edit view of
drafts, so you can convert your drafts before publishing them*). You’ll get a
popup with Markdown text. Select all and and copy and paste into any tool that
accepts Markdown.

Enjoy!
